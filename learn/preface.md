Before we start learning, let's go through the basic structure of this journey.

Frontend involves learning 3 main web technologies - <strong><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong>, <strong><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr></strong> and **JavaScript**. On top of these web technologies, one can master various domains like architecture, performance, accessibility, responsiveness etc (don't worry if those terms don't make sense right now). But I feel that instead of learning about these domains later on, its best to have a basic grasp of all of them from the beginning. Hence, we'll focus on basics of all these while learning the web technologies.

Web is a medium of communication - that happens through web pages. And to create a basic web page, the most important thing is the content - what you want to communicate. **HTML** is what you use to write the content of your web page and that is what we'll learn about first. By just learning to write the HTML correctly, you are ready to create working web pages. HTML will be followed by **CSS** (for visual styling) and then **JavaScript** (for advanced scripting).
