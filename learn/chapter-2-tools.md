There are some tools that we need to have installed on our computer before we can start creating and seeing our webpage.

## Code Editor

Editor is a software that let's us edit our files. At the very minimum, a text file editor works for us. But there are special text editors that make writing code a lot easier for us with their code-specific features like auto-completition, syntax highlighting etc. If you have a code editor already installed, then good. If not, I'll recommend you install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" rel="external">Visual Studio Code</a>. It's a great lightweight code editor by Microsoft.

## Browser

The software that you are using right now to see this website is called a Browser. We'll use this browser to test our webpages. Just in case, you want to install one any way, I'll recommend you install <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" rel="external">Google Chrome</a>. It has a good set of developer tools that we can leverage later to become more efficient in our development.

## In-browser Development Environment

Though an Editor and a browser is sufficient to start Frontend development, there is an additional tool that reduces some friction in the whole development process - **"Real-time frontend playgrounds"**. What's that? I'll tell you. So with an Editor and browser installed, here is how the development process will be like:

1. Write code in a file inside Code editor.
2. Switch to browser and open that file to see preview.
3. Switch back to Code Editor and update the code.
4. Switch to browser and refresh the webpage to see latest preview.

A Frontend playground is a web app that is a combination of an editor and browser preview. In a single screen, you can edit your code and alongside see a realtime preview of your code that auto-refreshes with every code change. Sweet! right?

There are may Frontend playgrounds out there, but I'll recommend <a href="https://webmakerapp.com/app/" rel="external">Web Maker</a> because it's easy to use and works even when you are offline!! So head there and signup. You are free to use Web Maker to practice everything you learn here.
