Before we officially start learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I think it would be good to have your first webpage running in the browser - just to get a feel. Follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Fire up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor.
2. Create a new file from the _File_ menu at the top and name it `first-webpage.html`
3. Copy and paste the following HTML into the file you just created:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My first webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my first page</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Open the `first-webpage.html` in the file explorer of your Operating System (Finder in MacOSX, Explorer in Windows, Nautilus in Ubuntu and so on...). And then double-click to open it. This will open your HTML file in your computer's default browser. Tada! There's your first webpage in front of you!
