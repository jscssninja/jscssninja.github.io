Before learning Frontend development, let's first understand what exactly we mean by "Frontend". For that, let's see what happened when you opened the URL of this website in your browser.

1. You enter "https://learnfrontend.dev" in the browser address bar.
2. A request (network call over the Internet) goes to a remote server (computer) asking for the corresponding webpage.
3. Now that remote server does some processing on it's end. This is what we call Backend - The work that happened away from your sight, on a remote server.
4. When the backend work is finished, the server responds with mostly an HTML file (a file with .html extension) for that web page.
5. When your browser receives this HTML file (and later some more files as we'll see), it shows it in **front** of you. So the thing which we see in **front** of us, is what we call the Frontend.

Now, this is a very crude explanation of what happens on opening a web page, but it should give you a basic view of what's Backend and what's Frontend.
And if you had the same understanding about Frontend before reading this, you are at the right place. üëçüèº

### Summary

If we were to summarise the basic workflow of a Frontend developer, it would be as follows:

1. Write code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
2. Test your code that you wrote.
3. Place these files on some remote server, which will send them to anyone requesting to see your website.

Of course, with project complexity and scale, several other things come into this is workflow.
