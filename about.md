Hello! My name is Kushagra Gour. I have been a full-time frontend developer for 7 years and now an indiependent product maker. This website is an attempt to collect and share whatever knowledge I have gained over the past years in the field of Frontend development. Also, I wanted to create a a very easily accessible and consumable starting point for someone who has a wish today to start learning Frontend development.

I hope I can make learning Frontend fun and easy for you!

Happy Reading! 👋🏽
